# FinSharp: Virtual Stock Market Simulation Game

FinSharp is a web-based virtual stock market simulation game built using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Socket.io for instant data transmission. The game aims to impart financial literacy among students through an interactive and engaging experience of trading in the stock market.
